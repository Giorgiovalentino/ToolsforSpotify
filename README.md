# ToolsforSpotify

# Instructions
ToolsforSpotify is a web application that allows you to easily delete multiple tracks in a selected playlist at once. Once you have chosen the desired tracks to delete from your playlist, hit the delete tracks button. Upon clicking this button, you are able to select more songs to delete or pick a new playlist to delete tracks from by hovering over "playlists" in the navigation bar.

#Known Bugs
If a user has duplicate songs, checking one song in the playlist table will delete all occurances of that song in the selected playlist.
